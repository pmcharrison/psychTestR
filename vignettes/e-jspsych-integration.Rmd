## About 

[jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) is a powerful library for constructing 
behavioral experiments in Javascript.
It is possible to embed jsPsych within psychTestR.
This is useful when you want to take advantage of jsPsych's timed 
stimulus presentation facilities.

## Compatibility notes

This tutorial was written with reference to jsPsych 6.1.0.
Unfortunately the jsPsych API is subject to change, which means
that the code provided in this tutorial may need some editing
to work with future versions of jsPsych. Please contact the package maintainer
if you notice problems along these lines.

## Tutorial

Normally we create a jsPsych test by writing an HTML file.
Here is the 'Hello World' example from the 
[jsPsych website](https://www.jspsych.org/tutorials/hello-world/):

``` HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My experiment</title>
        <script src="jspsych-6.1.0/jspsych.js"></script>
        <script src="jspsych-6.1.0/plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js"></script>
        <link href="jspsych-6.1.0/css/jspsych.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></link>
    </head>
    <body></body>
    <script>

    var hello_trial = {
        type: 'html-keyboard-response',
        stimulus: 'Hello world!'
    }

    jsPsych.init({
        timeline: [hello_trial]
    })

    </script>
</html>
```

We're going to get this example running in psychTestR.
The first step is to download the jsPsych source code from
the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases),
unzip the release file,
and save the resulting directory as a subdirectory of your 
current working directory, called for example `jspsych-6.1.0`.

To incorporate this code into psychTestR, we first create a file
called `new-timeline.js`, where we define a function that creates
a jsPsych timeline.

``` js
function new_timeline() {
  var hello_trial = {
    type: 'html-keyboard-response',
    stimulus: 'Hello world!'
  };
  return [hello_trial];
}
```

We then make a second Javascript file, `run-jspsych.js`, containing the following 
boilerplate code:

``` js
function run_jspsych() {
  jsPsych.init({
    timeline: new_timeline(),
    display_element: 'js_psych',
    on_finish: function() {
      var json_data = jsPsych.data.get().json();
      Shiny.onInputChange("jspsych_results", json_data);
      next_page();
    }
  });
}
run_jspsych();
```

Finally, we create an R file called `my-test.R`, 
and define a psychTestR page that wraps the jsPsych test.
We do this using helper functions from the `htmltools` package,
which allow us to build HTML code programmatically from within R.

``` r
library(htmltools)
library(psychTestR)

jspsych_dir <- "jspsych-6.1.0"

head <- tags$head(
  includeScript(file.path(jspsych_dir, "jspsych.js")),
  includeScript(file.path(jspsych_dir, "plugins/jspsych-html-keyboard-response.js"))
)

ui <- tags$div(
  head, 
  includeScript("new-timeline.js"),
  includeScript("run-jspsych.js"),
  tags$div(id = "js_psych")
)

hello_world <- page(
  ui = ui,
  label = "hello_world",
  get_answer = function(input, ...) input$jspsych_results,
  validate = function(answer, ...) nchar(answer) > 0L,
  save_answer = TRUE
)
```

We can then run this as a full psychTestR test by adding
the following code to `my-test.R`:

``` r
elts <- list(
  one_button_page("You are about to take the 'Hello world' test."),
  one_button_page("When you see 'Hello world', press SPACE to continue."),
  hello_world,
  elt_save_results_to_disk(complete = TRUE),
  final_page("You finished the test.")
)

test <- make_test(
  elts = elts,
  opt = demo_options(
    display = display_options(
      full_screen = TRUE, 
      css = file.path(jspsych_dir, "css/jspsych.css"))
  ))
  
shiny::runApp(test)
```

Note that we've added two display options:

- `full_screen = TRUE` sets the test to display in fullscreen, 
to reflect the default display configuration of jsPsych.
- `css = file.path(jspsych_dir, "css/jspsych.css")`
tells psychTestR to incorporate the default jsPsych style sheet.
You can provide multiple CSS files to this argument if you wish
to incorporate your own CSS styling.

We can now inspect the test results by loading the generated RDS file
in `output/results/`. You can do this by clicking on the file 
in the RStudio viewer, or by using the `readRDS` function.
Using the function `as.list()` to coerce the results file to a readable format,
we can see that the jsPsych output has been saved as a JSON string 
in the slot `$results$hello_world`. 

This proof of concept should extend naturally to more sophisticated 
jsPsych tests. In particular, you will want to extend `new-timeline.js`
to provide a timeline that describes your desired experimental structure.
You can also extend `run-jspsych.js` to incorporate various options that 
you would normally pass to `jsPsych.init()`,
as well as passing additional CSS files to `display_options`.
Good luck! Please contact the package maintainer if you encounter 
any issues.
